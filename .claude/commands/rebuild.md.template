Build the extension and copy to Windows for Chrome reload.

**Setup**: Copy this file to `rebuild.md` and customize the path:

```bash
cp .claude/commands/rebuild.md.template .claude/commands/rebuild.md
```

Then edit `rebuild.md` with your Windows path, or set the `TABZ_WIN_PATH` environment variable.

```bash
# Use env var if set, otherwise try common Windows desktop location
WIN_DEST="${TABZ_WIN_PATH:-/mnt/c/Users/$USER/Desktop/TabzChrome/dist-extension/}"

npm run build && rsync -av --delete dist-extension/ "$WIN_DEST"
```

After running, tell the user to reload the extension in Chrome at `chrome://extensions`.

If the path doesn't exist, suggest the user set `TABZ_WIN_PATH` in their shell config:
```bash
export TABZ_WIN_PATH="/mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/path/to/TabzChrome/dist-extension/"
```
