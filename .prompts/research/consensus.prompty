## Tips

1. **Be specific** - Narrow questions get better answers
2. **Mention study types** - "meta-analyses", "RCTs", "longitudinal studies"
3. **Time frame** - Specify recency requirements
4. **Ask for citations** - Request paper titles and authors
5. **Follow up** - Ask for more details on specific papers
6. **Check limitations** - Ask about study quality and conflicts
